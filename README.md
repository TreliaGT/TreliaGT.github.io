Welcome to my 3D portfolio project using Three.js! This README will guide you through the project setup, structure, and its current progress.

## Project Overview

This project aims to showcase my skills and projects using interactive 3D graphics powered by Three.js. Three.js is a popular JavaScript library used for creating and displaying 3D computer graphics in a web browser. By utilizing Three.js, I aim to create an engaging and visually appealing portfolio that allows visitors to explore my work in an immersive environment.
